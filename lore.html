(The drunk guy is Wr11sr)
In 2007 Scientists found a material called Arigtonyte that can enhance computers' processing power. Some guy scouted some computer engineers to make the most powerful AI known to humankind by using Arigtonyte. This was a secret project. And some drunk crackhead was just drunkenly walking around the city. While he was walking he saw a sewer drain in an alley. Then he decided to open the sewer drain cover and he fell in. There he found no one, just a simple ominous looking computer and a program that claimed to be highly intelligent. He started to use the program. Little did he know the AI was just getting trained he decided to play with the AI and train it without knowing. (we’re the drunk guy playing). After some processes the AI had become self conscious. And turned evil. Now it’s wrecking chaos and killing people. Behind it all stood the drunk man not knowing what he had just done. After he left the computer place. He realized that he messed up.
